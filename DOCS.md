# 
An enterprise-grade Infrastructure is provided as a Service (IaaS) solution that can be managed through a browser-based \"Data Center Designer\" (DCD) tool or via an easy to use API. 

The API allows you to perform a variety of management tasks such as spinning up additional servers, adding volumes, adjusting networking, and so forth. It is designed to allow users to leverage the same power and flexibility found within the DCD visual tool. Both tools are consistent with their concepts and lend well to making the experience smooth and intuitive.

# **backupunitsPost**
> BackupUnit backupunitsPost(backupUnit, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, xContractNumber=xContractNumber)

Create a Backup Unit

Create a Backup Unit. A Backup Unit is considered a resource like a virtual datacenter, IP Block, snapshot, etc. It shall be shareable via groups inside our User Management Feature 

### Example

```typescript

import { BackupUnitApi } from "ionoscloud";
import * as model from "ionoscloud/model/models";

// Create an instance of the API class
const api_instance = new BackupUnitApi('username','password');
const backupUnit =  // BackupUnit | Payload containing data to create a new Backup Unit
const pretty = true // boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
const depth = 56 // number | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children\'s children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
const xContractNumber = 56 // number | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional) (default to undefined)


try {
    // Create a Backup Unit
    api_instance.backupunitsPost(backupUnit, pretty, depth, xContractNumber).then(value => console.log(value));

# **datacentersPost**
> Datacenter datacentersPost(datacenter, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, xContractNumber=xContractNumber)

Create a Data Center

Virtual data centers are the foundation of the platform. They act as logical containers for all other objects you will be creating, e.g. servers. You can provision as many data centers as you want. Datacenters have their own private network and are logically segmented from each other to create isolation. You can use this POST method to create a simple datacenter or to create a datacenter with multiple objects under it such as servers and storage volumes.

### Example

```typescript

import { DataCenterApi } from "ionoscloud";
import * as model from "ionoscloud/model/models";

// Create an instance of the API class
const api_instance = new DataCenterApi('username','password');
const datacenter =  // Datacenter | Datacenter to be created
const pretty = true // boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
const depth = 56 // number | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children\'s children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
const xContractNumber = 56 // number | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional) (default to undefined)


try {
    // Create a Data Center
    api_instance.datacentersPost(datacenter, pretty, depth, xContractNumber).then(value => console.log(value));
} catch(e) {
    console.log(`Exception when calling DataCenterApi->datacentersPost: ${e}\n`)
}

```

# **k8sNodepoolsNodesReplacePost**
> object k8sNodepoolsNodesReplacePost(k8sClusterId, nodepoolId, nodeId, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, xContractNumber=xContractNumber)

Recreate the Kubernetes node

You can recreate a single Kubernetes Node.  Managed Kubernetes starts a process which based on the nodepool\'s template creates & configures a new node, waits for status \"ACTIVE\", and migrates all the pods from the faulty node, deleting it once empty.

const api_instance = new NicApi('username','password');
const datacenterId = datacenterId_example // string | The unique ID of the datacenter (default to undefined)
const serverId = serverId_example // string | The unique ID of the Server (default to undefined)
const nic =  // Nic | Nic to be created
const pretty = true // boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
const depth = 56 // number | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children\'s children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
const xContractNumber = 56 // number | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional) (default to undefined)


try {
    // Create a Nic
    api_instance.datacentersServersNicsPost(datacenterId, serverId, nic, pretty, depth, xContractNumber).then(value => console.log(value));

# **datacentersServersDelete**
> object datacentersServersDelete(datacenterId, serverId, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, xContractNumber=xContractNumber)

Delete a Server

This will remove a server from your datacenter; however, it will not remove the storage volumes attached to the server. You will need to make a separate API call to perform that action

### Example

```typescript

import { ServerApi } from "ionoscloud";
import * as model from "ionoscloud/model/models";

// Create an instance of the API class
const api_instance = new ServerApi('username','password');
const datacenterId = datacenterId_example // string | The unique ID of the datacenter (default to undefined)
const serverId = serverId_example // string | The unique ID of the Server (default to undefined)
const pretty = true // boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)

# **datacentersServersPut**
> Server datacentersServersPut(datacenterId, serverId, server, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, xContractNumber=xContractNumber)

Modify a Server

Allows to modify the attributes of a Server. From v5 onwards \'allowReboot\' attribute will no longer be available. For certain server property change it was earlier forced to be provided. Now this behaviour is implicit and backend will do this automatically e.g. in earlier versions, when CPU family changes, the \'allowReboot\' property was required to be set to true which will no longer be the case and the server will be rebooted automatically

### Example

```typescript

import { ServerApi } from "ionoscloud";
import * as model from "ionoscloud/model/models";

// Create an instance of the API class
const api_instance = new ServerApi('username','password');
const datacenterId = datacenterId_example // string | The unique ID of the datacenter (default to undefined)
const serverId = serverId_example // string | The unique ID of the server (default to undefined)
const server =  // Server | Modified Server
const pretty = true // boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
const depth = 56 // number | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children\'s children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
const xContractNumber = 56 // number | Users having more than 1 contract need to provide contract number, against which all API requests should be executed (optional) (default to undefined)


try {
    // Modify a Server
    api_instance.datacentersServersPut(datacenterId, serverId, server, pretty, depth, xContractNumber).then(value => console.log(value));

# **datacentersServersStopPost**
> object datacentersServersStopPost(datacenterId, serverId, pretty=pretty, depth=depth, xContractNumber=xContractNumber)

Stop a Server

This will stop a server. The machine will be forcefully powered off, billing will cease, and the public IP, if one is allocated, will be deallocated. The operation is not supported for Cube servers.

### Example

```typescript

import { ServerApi } from "ionoscloud";
import * as model from "ionoscloud/model/models";

// Create an instance of the API class
const api_instance = new ServerApi('username','password');
const datacenterId = datacenterId_example // string | The unique ID of the datacenter (default to undefined)
const serverId = serverId_example // string | The unique ID of the Server (default to undefined)
const pretty = true // boolean | Controls whether response is pretty-printed (with indentation and new lines) (optional) (default to true)
const depth = 56 // number | Controls the details depth of response objects.  Eg. GET /datacenters/[ID]  - depth=0: only direct properties are included. Children (servers etc.) are not included  - depth=1: direct properties and children references are included  - depth=2: direct properties and children properties are included  - depth=3: direct properties and children properties and children\'s children are included  - depth=... and so on (optional) (default to 0)
